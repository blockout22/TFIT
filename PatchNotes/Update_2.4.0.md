SML3.7/server support.




This update brought to you by Robb.
If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## New Stuff

- SML3.7/server support

## For Developers

The [Developer Readme](https://github.com/blockout22/TFIT/blob/main/DEV_README.md) has information on how to extend TFIT's functionality in your own mods.

## Known Bugs

- Some plants don't show up on the foliage overlay
- If a mod modifies content via a Content Default Object modification, it does not leave any trace that is detectable by TFIT. This means that TFIT will not be able to detect what mod modified the modified content, and could still credit it as being from Satisfactory.
- Fluids will occasionally display their stack size as -0 m^3 the first time their tooltip is displayed. Opening the tooltip again will fix this.
